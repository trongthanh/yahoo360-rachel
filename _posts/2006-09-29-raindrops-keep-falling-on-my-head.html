<div style="text-align:center; "><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/dtb1IucBH5A" width="425" height="350" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" allowScriptAccess="none"></embed> <br /><font size="2">(A clip from Spider-man 2)</font></div> <p><br /><font color="#0060bf" face="Georgia, Helvetica">I ran into this song when I was watching "Spider-man 2". The music is not very catchy but I like this song because the guy in the song is just like me! "Nothing seems to fit, raindrops keep falling on my head". Why am I always unlucky?<img alt="Image" src="{{ '/assets/smileys2/02.gif' | relative_url }}" /> Is HE "sleeping on the job" and letting the "blues come to defeat me"? Whenever  I do something important, I can almost predict that I will face some troubles or obstacles.</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia, Helvetica"><font color="#0060bf">I found myself in Peter Parker (Spider-man) and Huh Joon (<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Tháº§n y Huh Joon</font>). That doesn't mean I'm a hero.<img alt="Image" src="{{ '/assets/smileys2/01.gif' | relative_url }}" /> But they have an unfortunate destiny like me, at least at the start. That's the reason why I like watching these films. I'm curious  about how they get through their troubles and end up in happiness. Will I have the same happy ending? Will Peter Parker be able to marry Mary Jane?<img alt="Image" src="{{ '/assets/smileys2/01.gif' | relative_url }}" /> Come what may, I'll never give up.</font> </font></p> <div style="text-align:center; ">__________________________</div> <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#d0d0d0"><font size="4">Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head</font> <br />- B.J.
