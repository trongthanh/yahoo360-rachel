Exmortis begins with you waking up in the woods with a lump on your head and unable to recall how you got there. All you recall are the dreams. Regaining focus, you see a house up ahead and decide that shelter there is better than freezing to death in the woods. Think of the house at the end of Blair Witch and you'll be right at home. <p>Turn down the lights and turn up the sound for this game. Exmortis contains some violence and is therefore not appropriate for all audiences.</p> <div><a href="http://fizzlebot.com/bleffler/exmortis.swf">Click here</a></div> <br /> <br />  <strong> EXMORTIS 2</strong><br /> <br /> <br /> From <a href="http://www.lefflerwebdesign.cjb.net/">Ben Leffler</a> of Australia comes this dark and foreboding tale of the macabre that will surely send chills down your spine.
