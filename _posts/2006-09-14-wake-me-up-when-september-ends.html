<p><font size="2"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Summer has come and passed<br />
The innocent can never last<br />
wake me up when september ends<br />
<br />
like my fathers come to pass<br />
seven years has gone so fast<br />
wake me up when september ends<br />
<br />
here comes the rain again<br />
falling from the stars<br />
drenched in my pain again<br />
becoming who we are<br />
<br />
as my memory rests<br />
but never forgets what I lost<br />
wake me up when september ends<br />
<br />
summer has come and passed<br />
the innocent can never last<br />
wake me up when september ends<br />
<br />
ring out the bells again<br />
like we did when spring began<br />
wake me up when september ends<br />
<br />
here comes the rain again<br />
falling from the stars<br />
drenched in my pain again<br />
becoming who we are<br />
<br />
as my memory rests<br />
but never forgets what I lost<br />
wake me up when september ends<br />
<br />
Summer has come and passed<br />
The innocent can never last<br />
wake me up when september ends<br />
<br />
like my father's come to pass<br />
twenty years has gone so fast<br />
wake me up when september ends<br />
wake me up when september ends<br />
wake me up when september ends</font></font></p>
