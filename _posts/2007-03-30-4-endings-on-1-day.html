<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/1175274246-sc-99.jpg" ></div><br><p><font size="3">Today I have totally 4 endings. The outcome of Project 2 and also the end of Quarter 4 at NIIT. Today is also the last day of the 2 classes that I have been teaching for 6 months at Quang Trung language center. Not many things to say... they're all OK.<img src="{{ '/assets/emoticons/1.gif' | relative_url }}" /></font></p> <p><font size="3">Anyway, I still didn't have the chance to take a photograph of the whole class at NIIT. The funny thing is one of the 2 girls in my class hates taking photograph. I've got her photo already and I'm gonna blackmail her, kekkek. That's a fortune.<img src="{{ '/assets/emoticons/19.gif' | relative_url }}" /> (BTW, thank Bình Béo again for lending your camera.)<img src="{{ '/assets/emoticons/1.gif' | relative_url }}" /></font></p> <p><font size="3">Thank you for joining my project teams, mates! Though you don't understand Java much but you've tried your best to complete the project. We've had some good times when we got together. Hope to see you again in the next quarter.</font><img src="{{ '/assets/emoticons/8.gif' | relative_url }}" /></p> <p><font size="3">Feeling a little sad when I don't teach those students any more. They've studied with me for the longest time since I started teaching at QT.<img src="{{ '/assets/emoticons/2.gif' | relative_url }}" /></font></p><a href="http://img2.freeimagehosting.net/image.php?b34ffc413d.jpg"></a> <p><font size="3">Thank you, my dear students, for co-operating with me during the last 3 courses. Hope you will continue your studying and make far progress in English.<img src="{{ '/assets/emoticons/6.gif' | relative_url }}" /></font></p> <p><a href="http://img2.freeimagehosting.net/image.php?b34ffc413d.jpg"><img alt="Free Image Hosting by FreeImageHosting.net" src="http://img2.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/th.b34ffc413d.jpg" /></a></p> <p><font size="3">That's it. Next week (or the week after next) I'm gonna have all new classes. New friends and new students. Hope everything will be OK. Must take some rest right now.<img src="{{ '/assets/emoticons/28.gif' | relative_url }}" /></font></p>
