<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/1158503827-sc-31.jpg" ></div><br><p><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lolly -</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I see you falling <br />
It's my name your calling <br />
I rush to be by your side <br />
You know i'm always here <br />
So theres nothing to fear <br />
Now wipe away all your tears <br />
A shoulder to cry on <br />
Someone to rely on <br />
I'll do anything for you <br />
You are my best friend <br />
On me you can depend <br />
Our friendship will never end <br />
Remember...</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">(Chorus) <br />
Big boys don't cry <br />
Big boys don't cry <br />
Big boys don't cry <br />
Big boys don't cry</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Always forever <br />
Well be together <br />
Destiny leads the way <br />
If we both follow <br />
There'll be no sorrow <br />
So let nature take it's way <br />
Remember....</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">(Repeat Chorus to fade)</font></p>
