<font style="font-family:Georgia, Helvetica;" size="3">I have just been back from a childhood friend’s wedding. When the noon was damn hot and the all the make-ups have been removed, the feelings still remain so fresh and so real.  </font><p> </p>  <p><font size="3">He appeared so young and cheerful in his white wedding suit, with his hands waving at me and a deep blue smile heading towards me. Yes, this is the boy I used to know, after all those years of embarrassment and dilemma between friendship and something-more-than-just-friends. Finally, I feel quite relieved that he found a happy destination for his life anchor. His bride, who is so young yet so defined, partly assures my cheers of life-long happiness for the new couple. Cheers!!</font></p>  <p> </p>  <p><font size="3">Children in my neighborhood, not except me, are grateful for this naughty boy who made up all those crazy stories and sweet memories for our childhoods - playing badminton early each morning, building a wooden house or a dreamy world for all of us, raising rabbits, celebrating mid-autumn parties, stealing fruits of the neighboring trees… I was twelve and he was sixteen.<span style="">  </span>I knew nothing but, I guess, he knew something. <img src="{{ '/assets/emoticons/65.gif' | relative_url }}"/></font></p>  <p> </p>  <p><font size="3">Then his family moved to another area not too far away from our old neighborhood. We had our own school lives and suddenly got closed again when I was seriously ill in my sophomore time. He took me to school and back home everyday. We started some dates, and the experience was totally new for me. I was embarrassed wondering if friends normally do like this or not, and that I had never dated anyone before. Then, things turned out clear when I was a bit cold in the cinema for “Pirates of the Caribbean – The Curse of the Black Pearl” and he took my right hand for a second. It was a very short moment but I could feel… just something different. Proudly and wisely, I pulled the hand back and hid both behind my back, saying “I’m no longer feeling cold”. </font></p>  <p> </p>  <p><font size="3">At the time, I was still so deep into my puppy love though the boy I cared had gone abroad for nearly 2 years. I hurt him by not singing for him the songs I love, by not letting my heart open, by not giving him a chance. And he seemed to be deeply hurt that he cut off all the connections between us. There were times when he stopped by and let my family know his status, but we had no easy talk since then. I didn’t regret about my choice and I didn’t feel sorry for him, I was just so sorry that a long lasting friendship has turned into something indefinable and unpleasant, at least from my part.</font></p>  <p> </p>  <p><font size="3">There are things in life that don’t turn out the way we expect. I wished there had been no affection between us so that I could be care-free at the wedding today without being afraid that I could make him less happy. I hope my anticipation is wrong and that he is happier and luckier getting married to his young bride, hihi.<span style=""> <img src="{{ '/assets/emoticons/18.gif' | relative_url }}"/>I am thankful for what we had together, no matter what.</span></font> </p>  <p> </p>  <p><font size="3">Anyway, it’s the first time I’ve been to Sinh Đôi and the celebration was nice. Haizz, thinking about my wedding would make me dizzy. <img src="{{ '/assets/emoticons/17.gif' | relative_url }}"/><br /><br /> <br />  </font>  </p>
