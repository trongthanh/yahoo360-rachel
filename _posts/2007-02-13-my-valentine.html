Most of you have met him, but you never know him. <br />  Most of you don't like him, but you'll like him.<br />  Most of his "clumsy" actions and appearance may  disappoint you, but you'll sympathize.<br />  Most of my family reject him, but we'll be fine.<br />  <br />  Because he is just not the way he is.<br />  Because he acts more than speaks,  is responsible more than  flowery.<br />  Because he was not so lucky to be loved from childhood, and as a result, knows nothing to show his love for others even when he does love them.<br />  Because he loves and gives me happiness, encouragement as well as rhythm.<br />  <br />  If I am the only person in the world happen to know him and love him<br />  I'll make this whole world know him and love him as much as I do!<br />
