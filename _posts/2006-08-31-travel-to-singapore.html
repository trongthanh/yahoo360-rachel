Things to remember about Singapore:<br />
1. Cleanliness<br />
2. MRT (Mass Rapid Transit): fast, hi-tech, good view, polite<br />
3. Lots of trees<br />
4. Left-handed Traffic<br />
5. Mixture of many races: Chinese, Malaysian, Indian, Westen,..<br />
6. Singlish is hard to listen to. In the first 3 days, I couldn't figure out what language these people are speaking. My friends had to interpret while I stood still with big eyes and stupid face.<img src="http://l.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/34.gif" alt="Image" alt="Image" />  7. Public transportation and most activities are automatically activated. Each person owns a lot of cards.<br />
8. People walk a lot and very fast<br />
9. People wear fashionable clothes. Each weekend, it seems like they have nothing to do except going shopping in big big big shopping malls (with complicated road systems, at least for me <img src="http://l.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/01.gif" alt="Image" alt="Image" />)<br />
10. Many old people work as waiters/waitresses<br />
11. People live in flats. Going along the country on MRT/buses, you can only see big buildings in blocks, no house.<br />
12. Life here seems to be stressful. Everyone rushes. <br />
13. I like the atmosphere and the sight here. They are fresh, beautiful and carefully designed/planned.<br />
<br />
Friends: THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!<br />
<br />
CÃ´ng and Hoa welcome me warmly at the Budget Terminal and took me home. However, I had a feeling that I am making some troubles for all of my friends here because this time they are all very busy with their works, studying and accomodation.<br />
<br />
They took me to many places that are typical of Singapore. We chatted, took photographs, laughed and... yawned. I am the 5th person of 12Anh coming here to travel and visit them, so it's easy to understand how boring it is for them to go to certain places, repeat all those same explanations. I intended to ask them many things but I had to restrain to keep them away from repetition and boredom. <img src="http://l.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/05.gif" alt="Image" alt="Image" />  <br />
<br />
I stayed with TrÃ , from Sunday evening till the moment I left Singapore. She's different from herself 3 years ago. Uhm, I feel rather glad about that. She's more confident, well-organized, attractive, active and also more complicated, or, say, sophisticated. No matter how my head tells I am happy to see her like that, my heart still feels a little bit strange and cold in her. Maybe, it was just because she had an ache in her mouth that time so she couldn't speak much.<img src="http://l.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/03.gif" alt="Image" alt="Image" />  <br />
Now, I can partly understand how independent you can become if you live away from home. Yet, you can also be more aware of yourself, your lifestyle, your timetable, your health, your relations, etc. I am living with my family and everyone cares about me a lot. Though, I wanna try living alone in a different invironment to see how strong my will is. What do I have to do now? Which way should I choose? Will I be successful? Sometimes, I think struggling for careeers and money is meaningless if I don't have a stable and loving family, other times I desire to struggle to see how well can I deal with life, or at least to keep up with my friends.<br />
<br />
If I stay here any longer, I think I'll try to study in this place and be something different. Maybe, it's too late to start.<br />
<br />
However, wisedom is not always the only key to success. Who knows!<br />
