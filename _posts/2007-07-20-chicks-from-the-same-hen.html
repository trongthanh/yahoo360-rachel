Is "A drop of red blood is more precious than a pond of white water" a better one?<img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/emoticons7/18.gif" /> It's just I'm so sick of typing Vietnamese without the tone marks that I manage to use my poor English to compose this entry. You know, it always is a pressure for teachers of English to write something in English. Maybe, that is why Thanh, Moon, Duli, Katie, Mai The... rarely put their entries in English, haha <img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/emoticons7/35.gif" />(sorry! just a guess<img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/emoticons7/26.gif" />). Making<strong> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0); ">any</span></strong> grammatical or spe<strong style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0); ">l</strong>ing mistake<strong style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0); ">s</strong><span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0); "> </span><strong style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0); ">is </strong>a shame. We all know that there are people who are better at English than us. You are among those. "Le^u le^u" me if you see any!<img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/emoticons7/4.gif" /><br />  <br />  Forgive me for my beating around the bush, but by such a way I found two chicks of the same hen there, hehe (bad pun, isn't it?<img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/emoticons7/5.gif" />). <br />  <br />  Those two cutie chicks are my older brother and me. We did and still do kick each other, but our love never vanishes as we grow older and become more distant, geographically, psychologically and naturally. He has his own life, I go my own way but whenever we stay together, we become nothing else but two playful kids. I can't imagine that as childish as I am, he is much much much more than that, haha<img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/emoticons7/21.gif" />.<br />  <br />  He envied with my first love because I did not share my time and my secrets to him. I have to say that I've never felt so with his gf. He gets goose-flesh when he overhears the sweet words my bf says to me on Ya!mess (although his "live" words to his gf are more "sorry, unbearable" <img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/emoticons7/31.gif" />- xin loi chiu hong noi). How strange! We can never say sweet words to each other. <br />  </div></dd><dd><br /></dd><dd><div class="content-wrapper">(Viet giua chung nghi nau an, roi an toi nen... ba me mat hung roi<img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/emoticons7/16.gif" /><img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/emoticons7/71.gif" />)</div></dd><dd><div class="content-wrapper"><br />  It's so nice to spend my first and (maybe) only summer in Europe with him. We talk, we travel, we cycle, we cook and we eat. There are a lot of problems left for him and me, but we are trying to forget and enjoy. <br />  <br />  We are going to Rome for 5 days. Hope it will be great!</div></dd></dl>                By the way, thx all for commenting on my new hair style and wait for my new photo series in Rome.<img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/emoticons7/71.gif" /> "Du lich qua anh" is fun!<br />
