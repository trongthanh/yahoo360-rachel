<p>Send someone to love me<br />
I need to rest in arms<br />
Keep me safe from harm<br />
In pouring rain</p>
<p>Give me endless summer<br />
Lord I fear the cold<br />
Feel I'm getting old<br />
Before my time</p>
<p>As my soul heals the shame<br />
I will grow through this pain<br />
Lord I'm doing all I can<br />
To be a better man</p>
<p>Go easy on my conscience<br />
'Cause it's not my fault<br />
I know I've been told<br />
To take the blame</p>
<p>Rest assured my angels<br />
Will catch my tears<br />
Walk me out of here<br />
I'm in pain</p>
<p>As my soul heals the shame<br />
I will grow through this pain<br />
Lord I'm doing all I can<br />
To be a better man</p>
<p>Once you've found that lover<br />
You're homeward bound<br />
Love is all around<br />
Love is all around</p>
<p>I know some have fallen<br />
On stony ground<br />
But Love is all around</p>
<p>Send someone to love me<br />
I need to rest in arms<br />
Keep me safe from harm<br />
In pouring rain</p>
<p>Give me endless summer<br />
Lord I fear the cold<br />
Feel I'm getting old<br />
Before my time</p>
<p>As my soul heals the shame<br />
I will grow through this pain<br />
Lord I'm doin' all I can<br />
To be a better man</p>
