<p><font color="#bfdfff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#40a0ff">I've known James Blunt through Rachel with the song "You're beautiful". His voice is rather special. I've heard some of his songs and seen that they're all good. I love the refrain of this song; it is really James Blunt-ed</font> <img alt="Image" src="{{ '/assets/smileys2/01.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Image" />.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">How I wish I could surrender my soul; <br />
Shed the clothes that become my skin; <br />
See the liar that burns within my needing. <br />
How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold. <br />
How I wish I had screamed out loud, <br />
Instead I've found no meaning. <br />
<br />
I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain, <br />
All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble. <br />
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray. <br />
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble. <br />
It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain. <br />
<br />
How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind; <br />
Hold memory close at hand, <br />
Help me understand the years. <br />
How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell. <br />
How I wish I would save my soul. <br />
I'm so cold from fear. <br />
<br />
I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain, <br />
All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble. <br />
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray. <br />
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble. <br />
Far, far away; find comfort in pain. <br />
All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble. <br />
It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain.</font></p>
