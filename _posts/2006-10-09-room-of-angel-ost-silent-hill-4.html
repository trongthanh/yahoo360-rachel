It's melody sounds mysterious and a little bit scary (and of course it fits the settings of the game). The lyrics are scary as well. It's hard to describe my feeling when I listen to this song, something uncertain, something profound.</font></p>

<p>You lie silent there before me <br />
your tears they mean nothing to me <br />
the wind howling at the window <br />
the love you never gave <br />
I give to you</p>
<p>Really don't deserve it <br />
but now there's nothing you can do <br />
so sleep in your only memory of me <br />
my dearest mother</p>
<p>Here's a lullaby to close your eyes good-bye <br />
it was always you that I despised <br />
I don't feel enough for you to cry oh well <br />
here's a lullaby to close your eyes good-bye <br />
goodbye <br />
goodbye </p>
<p>So insignificant <br />
sleeping dormant deep inside of me <br />
are you hiding away lost <br />
under the sewers <br />
maybe flying high in the clouds <br />
perhaps you're happy without me <br />
so many seeds have been sown in the field <br />
and who could sprout up so blessedly <br />
if I had died <br />
I would have never felt sad at all <br />
you will not hear me say I'm sorry <br />
where is the light <br />
wonder if it's weeping somewhere</p>
<p>Here's a lullaby to close your eyes good-bye <br />
it was always you that I despised <br />
I don't feel enough for you to cry oh well <br />
here's a lullaby to close your eyes good-bye</p>
<p>Here's a lullaby to close your eyes good-bye <br />
it was always you that I despised <br />
I don't feel enough for you to cry oh well <br />
here's a lullaby to close your eyes good-bye <br />
good-bye <br />
good-bye <br />
good-bye <br />
good-bye</p>
<p>Here's a lullaby to close your eyes good-bye <br />
it was always you that I despised <br />
I don't feel enough for you to cry oh well <br />
here's a lullaby to close your eyes good-bye</p>
<p>Here's a lullaby to close your eyes good-bye <br />
it was always you that I despised <br />
I don't feel enough for you to cry oh well <br />
here's a lullaby to close your eyes good-bye <br />
good-bye <br />
good-bye <br />
good-bye <br />
good-bye</p>
