<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/1161017069-sc-55.jpg" ></div><br><p><font color="#80c0ff">An old song.  But it moves me whenever I listen to it.  Its melody is so sweet and its lyrics are so... (can't explain <img alt="Image" src="{{ '/assets/smileys2/01.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Image" /> ). Stratovarius? I can bet my shoes that many of us who know this song know nothing about them, let alone their faces <img alt="Image" src="{{ '/assets/smileys2/04.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Image" />. Okie, whoever they are, we still appreciate them for composing such a lovely song...</font></p>

<p>I stand alone in the darkness <br />
the winter of my life came so fast <br />
memories go back to my childhood <br />
to days I still recall </p>
<p>Oh how happy I was then <br />
there was no sorrow there was no pain <br />
walking through the green fields <br />
sunshine in my eyes </p>
<p>I'm still there everywhere <br />
I'm the dust in the wind <br />
I'm the star in the northern sky <br />
I never stayed anywhere <br />
I'm the wind in the trees <br />
would you wait for me forever ?</p>
