## Rachel Nguyen Yahoo! 360 blog

This is a resurrection of my SO blog hosted on Yahoo! 360, recreated in Jekyll / GH Page from the Internet Archive and her blog backup. These posts are some of her best writing and a good keep of our memories in the early year of the Internet.

To preview locally, install Ruby gem `bundler`, then install the `github-pages` plugins set with `bundle install` and finally execute: `bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental`.
